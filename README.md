Welcome to NIGHTBROOD! We are a level 75 Private server. Our mission is to bring back the nostalgia of 75 cap era in Final Fantasy XI. We have made some adjustments to improve the experience for new and veteran players alike. We are a group of players who have decided to make it better. We all have experience playing either in retail or in different private servers and we wanted to deliver a better time for players out there. We enjoy progress, but we are also against making it a huge time sink for veteran and new players. We have custom content, mainly to reduce the time spent doing grinding while still granting players a sense of achievement. We want players to collaborate while having the option of doing solo work to obtain great items. Salvage Gear, AV Gear, Limbus, Relics, Mythics, are all obtainable by a solo player. We are bringing the choice back to players. If you want to obtain the best gear possible at 75 cap, you can do it, but an alliance of players will have more challenging NMÂ´s and faster progress. We have a server transfer option (With certain limitations). Check our wiki for more information!
